    ## 🎯 **Why Manual Calculation is the Best Approach?**
    
    The IPL Win Probability Predictor follows a **manual calculation-based approach** instead of relying solely on machine learning models. Here’s why this method is superior for real-time match predictions:

    ---
    
    ## 🔍 **Advantages of Manual Calculation Over Machine Learning**
    
    ✅ **Transparency & Explainability**: Unlike machine learning models, where outcomes can be difficult to interpret, manual calculations provide a clear, step-by-step breakdown of the probability score.

    ✅ **Cricket-Specific Logic**: Machine learning models depend on historical data, which may not always reflect the real-time nature of a match. Manual calculations, however, directly incorporate cricketing logic such as run rate, momentum, and wicket impact.

    ✅ **No Overfitting or Data Dependency**: Machine learning models require vast amounts of past match data, and they may struggle with new scenarios. A manual approach ensures flexibility and accuracy across different match situations.

    ✅ **Real-Time Adjustments**: With manual calculations, users can tweak formulas and weights to align with current match conditions, something that ML models cannot dynamically adjust without retraining.

    ✅ **Fast & Efficient**: Manual calculations are computationally light and execute instantly, whereas ML models might require extensive processing time for predictions.

    ## 🏏 **Final Words**
    
    While machine learning models can be useful in some scenarios, the unpredictable nature of cricket makes manual calculations a **more accurate, flexible, and reliable** approach. This model ensures that every factor affecting the game is considered, providing **real-time, dynamic, and interpretable** win probability insights.
